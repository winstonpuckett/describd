# The problem

I was laying in bed one night thinking about grocery lists. I realized all of the home management / grocery list type apps use a "todo" format. This makes sense on the surface, as throwaway-able paper works much the same. You write something down, then you throw it away.

However, grocery lists are about describing the state of your house so that you understand what actions you need to take.

I wondered what other problems would be better described with a record of state. Thus the idea for "describd" was born.

# The solution

When you check a box, it should turn a different color. That way you know you're out. You can sort by title or "missing." Then when you're at the grocery store, you just look at the checked boxes and start un-checking them as you put things in your cart.

At that point, you're describing the state of your house. You'll never have to re-type the list again.
